## API using steps
1. Upload this API to your server using docker.
2. Add book categories using admin user (please see an example below). This API implements liquibase so all needed tables will be created in the DB automatically after launching the API. Also, admin user will be added. Login: admin@user.com, password: 12345.
3. Add books to your book store (please see an example below).
4. Done. Now new users can register to your book store and order books. To see new orders you can use method GET and an endpoint /api/orders/status/pending (please see an example below).
